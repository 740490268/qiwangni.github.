##  My past research spans across natural language processing, deep learning, data mining and computational social science.
Research Directions
Semantic parsing and program generation
Procedural knowledge understanding
Commonsense acquisition and reasoning
Indirect or weak supervision for NLP
Information extraction
providing a policy gradient for training the generator of the network.
my focus was primarily on generative modelling (generative adversarial networks, in particular),parsing and neural networks.
 I make NLP tasks feasible with less human effort by indirect or weak supervision and by building a two-way bridge between natural language text and structured knowledge, logic, relational data
 I am interested include text and code generation, contextualized and goal-oriented conversation, low-resource languages, reading comprehension, knowledge acquisition, reasoning and inference, grounded language learning, interpretable and structured models as well as NLP for social good.
